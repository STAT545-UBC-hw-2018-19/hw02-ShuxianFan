# STAT545 Homework 2 Depository
This is the GitHub depository of Shuxian Fan for the [homework2](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw02/hw02.html) of STAT545A.

The goal is to explore the dataset `gapminder`using useful tools in R packages like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`. 

Here are the links for the corresponding files:

_For the peer reviewer_: For your convenience :wink:, here you can find the [peer review](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/peer-review.html) page and the [assignments page](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/) which stores the general evaluation rubrics.
